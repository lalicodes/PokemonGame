## Description

The Pokémon Pathfinding Project is an exciting game that revolves around implementing movement paths for trainers within a Pokémon-inspired world. In this game, trainers, including hikers and rivals, interact with the player character (PC) as they navigate through diverse terrains with unique movement costs and restrictions.

## Features
Interactive Pokémon-Inspired Game: Immerse yourself in a game reminiscent of the Pokémon world, complete with trainers, diverse terrains, and engaging pathfinding challenges.

Trainer Variety: Encounter various trainer types, including hikers and rivals. Each trainer type has distinct movement capabilities and terrain restrictions, adding depth to the gameplay.

Terrain Diversity: Explore a rich game world featuring different terrain types such as boulders, trees, paths, Pokémon Marts, Pokémon Centers, tall grass, short grass, water, and gates. Each terrain has its own associated movement costs and properties.

Movement Cost Table: Navigate through terrains with predefined movement costs. A table outlines the travel times for hikers and rivals across various terrains, adding strategic depth to the game.

PC and Terrain Interaction: Begin your adventure with the PC randomly placed on a road represented as '@.' The game's borders are marked with impassable terrain, ensuring that NPCs cannot access restricted areas.

Efficient Pathfinding: Benefit from efficient pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm or A*, to calculate the shortest paths from all locations to the PC for hikers and rivals. A priority queue ensures optimized path calculations.

Visualized Distance Maps: Witness the game's progress through color-coded distance maps for trainers. The maps display distances with two digits per distance value and spaces for readability
