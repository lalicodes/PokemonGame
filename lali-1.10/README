For assignment 2, I chose to create the classic computer game, Minesweeper! All the game controls are integrated into the game interface and are operated via keyboard inputs. The game offers two modes:

First, you must compile the program by running 'make'.
To play the game in its standard mode, execute './minesweeper'.
For cheat mode, run './minesweeper cheat'. This mode displays all mines, aiding in verifying that the game functions correctly but remember not to click on the mines to keep the challenge intact.
You can start a new game by pressing 'n' after each round or exit the game as you wish.

Enjoy playing!
