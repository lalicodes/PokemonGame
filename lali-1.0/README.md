## Description
This terrain generator creates a map for a Pokémon-inspired game. It features an 80x21 grid, representing various terrains, paths, and buildings. The generator aims to provide a realistic and immersive environment with accessible Pokémon Centers and Pokémarts, challenging terrains of tall grass and water, and navigable paths.

## Features
- **80x21 Grid:** Fits standard terminal dimensions for easy viewing.
- **Intersecting Paths:** At least one N-S and one E-W path that intersect within the map.
- **Pokémon Center & Pokémart:** Accessible buildings represented by 'C' and 'M' without traversing tall grass.
- **Diverse Terrain:** Includes tall grass, water regions, clearings, rocks, and boulders.
- **Defined Borders:** The map is enclosed by immovable boulders with one exit on each side.
- **Realistic Design:** Paths and terrains are designed to mimic real-world irregularities and obstacles.
